    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain use cases for a 1-sample z-test\n",
    "* Set up null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "* Use the z-table and scipy methods to acquire the p value for a given z-score\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret p-value for significance of results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "A fast-food chain claims that the mean time to order food at their restaurants is 60 seconds, with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. You decide to put this claim to the test and go to one of the restaurants to observe actual waiting times. You take a sample of 36 customers and find that the mean order time was 75 seconds. Does this finding provide enough evidence to contradict the fast food chain's claim of fast service?\n",
